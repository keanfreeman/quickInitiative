# Quick Initiative
A simple, mobile-friendly web application for rolling initiative in popular role-playing games. The website 
lives at [QuickInitiative.us](http://quickinitiative.us) 

While the functionality for this web app exists elsewhere, I wasn't satisfied with what was 
available. All I needed was a tool that kept track of initiative order, but 
the tools available either weren't mobile-friendly, cluttered the screen with more features than 
were necessary, or did the job of repeated initiative rolling pretty poorly. I wanted an initiative tracker 
that was so simple, I could let even a newer player take care of setting up and running initiative 
while I was busy with my duties as Game Master.

As always, the only way to get exactly what you want is to make it yourself. I hope others find 
this tool useful, and if you think a change would make this tool work better, give it a shot! 
That's what it's here for.
